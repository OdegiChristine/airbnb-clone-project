# 🏡 Airbnb Clone Backend

## 📌 About the Project

The **Airbnb Clone Project** is a comprehensive full-stack application inspired by the functionality of Airbnb. It emphasizes backend development and is designed to teach learners how to build scalable, secure, and efficient systems. By simulating a real-world booking platform, the project covers a wide range of backend concepts—from database modeling to API design and system optimization.

---

## 🎯 Objective

The goal of this backend system is to provide a solid foundation for core Airbnb functionalities, including:

- Managing user accounts and profiles
- Hosting and browsing property listings
- Booking accommodations
- Handling payments securely
- Collecting and displaying user reviews
- Optimizing data access for performance and scalability

---

## 🏆 Project Goals

- **User Management**: Secure registration, login, and profile management.
- **Property Management**: CRUD operations for property listings.
- **Booking System**: Handle property reservations with date tracking.
- **Payment Processing**: Integrate secure payment mechanisms.
- **Review System**: Enable users to post and view reviews/ratings.
- **Data Optimization**: Improve performance with indexing and caching.

## ⚙️ Technology Stack

The following technologies were chosen to ensure a scalable, maintainable, and efficient backend system:

- **Django**: A high-level Python web framework used to build the core of the backend application, including API endpoints, business logic, and admin interfaces.

- **Django REST Framework (DRF)**: An extension of Django that simplifies the creation of RESTful APIs, enabling CRUD operations for users, properties, bookings, and more.

- **PostgreSQL**: A powerful and reliable relational database system used to store structured data such as user profiles, property listings, bookings, reviews, and payments.

- **GraphQL**: A query language and runtime for APIs that provides clients with the flexibility to request exactly the data they need, reducing over-fetching and improving performance.

- **Celery**: An asynchronous task queue used to handle background jobs such as sending email notifications, processing payments, and scheduling tasks.

- **Redis**: An in-memory data structure store used for caching frequently accessed data and managing Celery task queues for performance optimization.

- **Docker**: A containerization platform that packages the application and its dependencies into isolated containers, ensuring consistency across development, testing, and production environments.

- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment tools (e.g., GitHub Actions or GitLab CI) that automate testing, linting, and deployment workflows to improve development efficiency and code quality.

## 👥 Team Roles

To ensure a successful and efficient development process, the Airbnb Clone Project is structured around clearly defined roles. Each team member contributes their expertise to different aspects of the system.

### 🧠 Project Manager (PM)

**Responsibility**: Oversees project timelines, task delegation, and coordination between teams. Ensures the project aligns with goals and deadlines, and communicates progress to stakeholders.

### 🧱 Backend Developer

**Responsibility**: Designs and implements the core server-side logic using Django and Django REST Framework. Handles API development, authentication, property management, and booking logic.

### 🛢️ Database Administrator (DBA)

**Responsibility**: Designs and maintains the PostgreSQL database schema. Optimizes queries, manages migrations, enforces data integrity, and implements indexing and performance strategies.

### ⚙️ DevOps Engineer

**Responsibility**: Sets up Docker environments and manages CI/CD pipelines. Ensures smooth deployments, version control workflows, and oversees containerization and scalability setups.

### 🔁 API Integration Specialist

**Responsibility**: Focuses on the integration of third-party services such as payment gateways and notification systems. Ensures seamless communication between internal and external APIs.

### 📦 QA Engineer / Tester

**Responsibility**: Writes test cases, performs manual and automated testing on API endpoints and application workflows. Ensures that bugs are caught early and that features meet requirements.

### 🔐 Security Specialist

**Responsibility**: Implements authentication, authorization, and data protection mechanisms. Performs vulnerability assessments and ensures the backend complies with security best practices.

### 📄 Documentation Lead

**Responsibility**: Maintains API documentation (OpenAPI), README files, developer guides, and onboarding instructions. Ensures that internal and external documentation is always up-to-date and accurate.
