# 🏡 Airbnb Clone Backend

## 📌 About the Project

The **Airbnb Clone Project** is a comprehensive full-stack application inspired by the functionality of Airbnb. It emphasizes backend development and is designed to teach learners how to build scalable, secure, and efficient systems. By simulating a real-world booking platform, the project covers a wide range of backend concepts—from database modeling to API design and system optimization.

---

## 🎯 Objective

The goal of this backend system is to provide a solid foundation for core Airbnb functionalities, including:

- Managing user accounts and profiles
- Hosting and browsing property listings
- Booking accommodations
- Handling payments securely
- Collecting and displaying user reviews
- Optimizing data access for performance and scalability

---

## 🏆 Project Goals

- **User Management**: Secure registration, login, and profile management.
- **Property Management**: CRUD operations for property listings.
- **Booking System**: Handle property reservations with date tracking.
- **Payment Processing**: Integrate secure payment mechanisms.
- **Review System**: Enable users to post and view reviews/ratings.
- **Data Optimization**: Improve performance with indexing and caching.

---

## ⚙️ Technology Stack

The following technologies were chosen to ensure a scalable, maintainable, and efficient backend system:

- **Django**: A high-level Python web framework used to build the core of the backend application, including API endpoints, business logic, and admin interfaces.

- **Django REST Framework (DRF)**: An extension of Django that simplifies the creation of RESTful APIs, enabling CRUD operations for users, properties, bookings, and more.

- **PostgreSQL**: A powerful and reliable relational database system used to store structured data such as user profiles, property listings, bookings, reviews, and payments.

- **GraphQL**: A query language and runtime for APIs that provides clients with the flexibility to request exactly the data they need, reducing over-fetching and improving performance.

- **Celery**: An asynchronous task queue used to handle background jobs such as sending email notifications, processing payments, and scheduling tasks.

- **Redis**: An in-memory data structure store used for caching frequently accessed data and managing Celery task queues for performance optimization.

- **Docker**: A containerization platform that packages the application and its dependencies into isolated containers, ensuring consistency across development, testing, and production environments.

- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment tools (e.g., GitHub Actions or GitLab CI) that automate testing, linting, and deployment workflows to improve development efficiency and code quality.

## 📊 Database Design

The backend database is designed to support the core functionalities of the Airbnb Clone platform, including user management, property listings, bookings, payments, and reviews. Below are the key entities and their relationships:

### 🧑 Users

Represents all users on the platform, including guests and hosts.

**Key Fields:**

- `id`: Unique identifier for each user
- `username`: User's login name
- `email`: User's contact email
- `password_hash`: Encrypted password
- `is_host`: Boolean flag indicating if the user can list properties

**Relationships:**

- A user can create **multiple properties**
- A user can make **multiple bookings**
- A user can write **multiple reviews**

---

### 🏠 Properties

Represents a property listed by a host.

**Key Fields:**

- `id`: Unique identifier for each property
- `title`: Title of the listing
- `description`: Detailed description of the property
- `location`: Physical address or coordinates
- `price_per_night`: Cost of booking per night

**Relationships:**

- A property **belongs to one user** (host)
- A property can have **multiple bookings**
- A property can receive **multiple reviews**

---

### 📅 Bookings

Represents a reservation made by a user for a property.

**Key Fields:**

- `id`: Unique identifier for each booking
- `user_id`: ID of the guest who made the booking
- `property_id`: ID of the property being booked
- `start_date`: Check-in date
- `end_date`: Check-out date

**Relationships:**

- A booking **belongs to one user**
- A booking **belongs to one property**
- A booking can have **one payment**

---

### 💳 Payments

Represents a payment transaction for a booking.

**Key Fields:**

- `id`: Unique identifier for each payment
- `booking_id`: ID of the associated booking
- `amount`: Total amount paid
- `status`: Payment status (e.g., pending, completed)
- `timestamp`: Date and time of the transaction

**Relationships:**

- A payment **belongs to one booking**

---

### 📝 Reviews

Represents feedback left by users for properties.

**Key Fields:**

- `id`: Unique identifier for each review
- `user_id`: ID of the reviewer
- `property_id`: ID of the property being reviewed
- `rating`: Numerical score (e.g., 1 to 5)
- `comment`: Written feedback

**Relationships:**

- A review **belongs to one user**
- A review **belongs to one property**
