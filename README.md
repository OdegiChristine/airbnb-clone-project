---

## ⚙️ Technology Stack

The following technologies were chosen to ensure a scalable, maintainable, and efficient backend system:

- **Django**: A high-level Python web framework used to build the core of the backend application, including API endpoints, business logic, and admin interfaces.

- **Django REST Framework (DRF)**: An extension of Django that simplifies the creation of RESTful APIs, enabling CRUD operations for users, properties, bookings, and more.

- **PostgreSQL**: A powerful and reliable relational database system used to store structured data such as user profiles, property listings, bookings, reviews, and payments.

- **GraphQL**: A query language and runtime for APIs that provides clients with the flexibility to request exactly the data they need, reducing over-fetching and improving performance.

- **Celery**: An asynchronous task queue used to handle background jobs such as sending email notifications, processing payments, and scheduling tasks.

- **Redis**: An in-memory data structure store used for caching frequently accessed data and managing Celery task queues for performance optimization.

- **Docker**: A containerization platform that packages the application and its dependencies into isolated containers, ensuring consistency across development, testing, and production environments.

- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment tools (e.g., GitHub Actions or GitLab CI) that automate testing, linting, and deployment workflows to improve development efficiency and code quality.

## 🧩 Feature Breakdown

This section outlines the main features of the Airbnb Clone backend and how each contributes to building a fully functional and scalable booking platform.

### 1. 📝 API Documentation

The backend APIs are documented using the OpenAPI standard, ensuring developers can easily understand and integrate with the system. With Django REST Framework and GraphQL, the platform supports both RESTful and flexible data querying, making it adaptable for various frontend needs.

### 2. 🔐 User Authentication

Users can register, log in, and manage their profiles through secure authentication endpoints. This feature ensures that both guests and hosts can interact with the system while protecting user data and enforcing role-based access control.

### 3. 🏠 Property Management

Hosts can create, update, retrieve, and delete property listings. This feature enables the core functionality of showcasing available accommodations and managing listing content dynamically.

### 4. 📆 Booking System

Users can make and manage reservations for listed properties. The system handles booking logic, including date selection and validation, ensuring that users can plan their stays and hosts can manage availability effectively.

### 5. 💳 Payment Processing

The payment system facilitates secure transactions for bookings and records financial details for accountability. This ensures trust between guests and hosts and supports a sustainable platform economy.

### 6. 📝 Review System

Guests can leave ratings and comments after their stays, helping build credibility and transparency on the platform. Reviews also provide valuable feedback to hosts and improve decision-making for future guests.

### 7. ⚡ Database Optimizations

To maintain high performance, the system uses indexing and caching techniques. These strategies ensure efficient data retrieval and reduce server load, especially as the application scales with more users and data.

## 🔐 API Security

Security is a critical aspect of the Airbnb Clone backend, especially given the sensitive nature of user data, financial transactions, and personal property listings. The following measures are implemented to ensure a secure and trustworthy platform:

### 🔑 Authentication

All endpoints that require user interaction are protected using token-based authentication (e.g., JWT). This ensures that only verified users can access protected resources like bookings, payments, or profile updates.

> **Why it matters**: Prevents unauthorized access to user accounts and ensures identity verification for each session.

---

### 🛂 Authorization

Role-based access control (RBAC) is implemented to restrict actions based on user roles (e.g., guest, host, admin). For example, only hosts can manage properties, and only users who made a booking can leave a review.

> **Why it matters**: Ensures users can only perform actions they are permitted to, protecting data integrity and business rules.

---

### 📉 Rate Limiting

Rate limiting is enforced to control the number of requests a user can make in a given time frame. This helps defend against brute-force attacks, abuse, and denial-of-service (DoS) scenarios.

> **Why it matters**: Protects the API from overload and malicious traffic, ensuring availability for all users.

---

### 🧪 Input Validation & Sanitization

All incoming data is validated and sanitized to prevent common vulnerabilities like SQL injection, XSS (Cross-Site Scripting), and CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery).

> **Why it matters**: Ensures that malicious inputs don’t compromise the application or underlying systems.

---

### 🔒 Secure Payment Handling

Payments are processed through a trusted third-party payment gateway with proper encryption and secure protocols. Sensitive data such as card details are never stored on the server.

> **Why it matters**: Protects financial data, builds user trust, and ensures PCI-DSS compliance for transaction security.

---

### 🧩 HTTPS Enforcement

All API traffic is encrypted using HTTPS to protect data in transit.

> **Why it matters**: Prevents eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks, especially on public or insecure networks.

---

> These security practices ensure that user data, platform integrity, and financial transactions remain protected at all times, laying the foundation for a trustworthy and scalable application.
